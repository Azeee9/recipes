        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Don't let the strong taste of fennel scare you: it fades down after cooking.
             This is a rich and creamy risotto, just like it ought to be! You can use 
             chicken stock in place of the vegetable stock, as well as olive oil for the butter.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 bulbs fennel</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked Arborio rice</li>
            <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
            <li>6 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the base off of the fennel bulbs,
                 and cut a cone shape into the base to 
                 remove the core. Slice the fennel vertically
                  (lengthwise) into 1/4 inch thick slices.</li>
                  <li>Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed stock pot over
                     medium heat. Cook onions and fennel in butter for
                      2 minutes. Stir in the rice; cook for another 2
                       minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly 
                       toasted. Stir in 1 cup vegetable broth; continue 
                       stirring until liquid is almost completely 
                       absorbed. Repeat this process with remaining 
                       broth, stirring constantly. Incorporating the 
                       broth should take 15 to 20 minutes in all.</li>
                  <li>Stir in cream, 3 tablespoons Parmesan and parsley,
                     and cook until rice is done and risotto is thick
                      and creamy. Season to taste with black pepper. 
                      Divide risotto among 6 bowls, and sprinkle with
                       remaining cheese.</li>
        </ol>
