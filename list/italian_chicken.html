        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            One of the easiest Italian chicken recipes:
             Boneless breasts marinated in Italian-style
              salad dressing, then baked. It's the simplest
               and most delicious meal ever, and my husband
                thinks I cook all day to make it!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Pour salad dressing into a large resealable plastic bag.
             Add chicken breasts, seal bag, and shake to coat. Marinate
              in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight (the 
              longer you marinate, the more flavor the chicken will 
              absorb).
           </li> 
           <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
           <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place in a lightly 
            greased 9x13-inch baking dish; discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning chicken occasionally,
                 until cooked through and juices run clear, about 1
                  hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
                   center should read at least 165 degrees F
                    (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
